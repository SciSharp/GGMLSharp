A safetensors file is a binary file. The struct of the file is headerLength + header + data. 
The headerLength is a Int64, which is the length of the header. 
The header is a JSON string, which contains the information of the tensor. 
The data is the binary data of the tensor. 

Json file is like this:

{
	"__metadata__":
	{
		"format":"pt"
	},
	"model.layers.0.self_attn.rotary_emb.inv_freq":
		{
			"dtype":"F32",
			"shape":[64],
			"data_offsets":[0,256]
		},
	"model.layers.1.self_attn.rotary_emb.inv_freq":
		{
			"dtype":"F32",
			"shape":[64],
			"data_offsets":[256,512]
		},

......


The data_offsets is the offset of the data in the Data offset but not in the whole file.
So the real offest in the file is 8(a int64 means the length of header) + headerLength + data_offsets .
